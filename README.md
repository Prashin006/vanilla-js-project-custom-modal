# üé≠ Custom Modal with CSS Animation

This project is a simple, custom-built modal window demonstrating fundamental web development concepts using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It features a modern, responsive design with smooth animations.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Custom Modal:** A fully functional modal window that appears on the screen when a button is clicked.
- **CSS Keyframe Animation:** The modal uses CSS `@keyframes` to animate its appearance, creating a smooth "slide-down" effect for a more polished user experience.
- **Multiple Closing Methods:** The modal can be closed in three different ways:
  - By clicking the dedicated "close" button (`&times;`).
  - By clicking outside the modal on the semi-transparent background.
  - By clicking the `Esc` key (This is a common feature in modern modals and a good practice to add).
- **Responsive Design:** The modal's position and appearance are handled with CSS, ensuring it remains centered and functional across different screen sizes.

| **HTML**                 | Structures the page with semantic elements for the button, modal container, and modal content.                                                                              |
| **CSS**                  | Handles all styling, including the background, button effects, and the core modal layout using `flexbox` and `positioning`. It also powers the animation with `@keyframes`. |
| **JavaScript (Vanilla)** | Manages the interactivity and state of the modal by adding event listeners to the "open" and "close" buttons, as well as the window, to control the `display` property.     |
